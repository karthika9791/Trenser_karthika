String Manipulation Program

C program for executing different c functionalities

Description:-

    This project is a c program that implements three different funcitons for 
converting the string that is given by the user to various forms. The entry poi-
nt is the main function in  the main.c file, which calls the string manipulation 
caller function strMnpCaller. The strMnpCaller function is defined in the 
string_ma-nipulation.c file. The user is provided by various options that can be 
performed on the input stirng. The options are defined as an enum Option. Depen-
ding upon the user input, the particular funciton is called. The function 
strMnpUpperLower is used to convert the uppercase letters in the string to lower 
case. The user can input the stirng on this function. The funciton iterates thr-
ough each characters of the string and if an uppercase is found the value 32 is 
added to the char to get the ascii value of the particular lowercase character. 
The function strMnpLowerUpper is used to convert the lowercase letters in the 
string to upper case. The user can input the stirng on this function. The funci-
tion iterates through each charaters of the string and if a lowercase is found 
the value 32 is subtracted to the char to get the ascii value of the particular 
uppercase character.
    The function strMnpConcatenate is used to concatenete two strings that is 
given by the user. The user is provided to input the first string followed by 
the second stirng, the first string iterated till the last element, the second 
string is added to the first after that. If the user inputs the last option the 
program exits. 

    The c library functions and function declarations are added in the main.h 
file. The program is compiled using gcc compiler. A makefile is created which 
creates the executable file string_operation. The code is executed using the co-
mmand: make 

Program Execution:
    The executable file is created using : make
    The generated file can be run using : ./executable file name.
